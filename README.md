## Electro-anammox

Metagenomics and differential expression analysis (DESeq2) of anodic biofilms of anammox bacteria that perform electrode-dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation.

When generating the files for binning in mmgenome2, the .RData file for Rstudio and the assembly.fasta of the metagenome are available for download in: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5n8zs7v7uq54f1p/AABI41crvzwQkhbPSP9djbpKa?dl=0. 

In the differential expression analysis, the genes in count tables and output of the DESeq2 analysis appear with the sequence ID from the annotation. In event that is required more information about these genes, in the folder you will find the .fasta file with the nucleotide sequences for each one of these BROELEC gene ID. 

Enjoy
